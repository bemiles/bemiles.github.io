## Research Opportunities

If you are interested in collaborating or pursuing research within my research group email me at bemiles@arizona.edu. 

I'm looking for an undergraduate for the <a href = "https://spacegrant.arizona.edu/students/u-internships"> Arizona Space Grant Program</a>, which is a PAID opportunity. The project description can be found <a href = "https://spacegrant.arizona.edu/project-Miles">here</a>. Applications are due May 25, 2025.


I am also looking for undergraduates to test off the shelf thermal infrared cameras for scientific and artistic purposes.

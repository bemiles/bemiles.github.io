##### Summary
Using NIRSpec and MIRI on JWST, the Early-release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems (Program #1386, PI: Sasha Hinkley) published the highest signal-to-noise, broadest wavelength coverage spectrum of planetary mass companion to date. We detected water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, silicate condensates and more within the spectrum (highlighted below).

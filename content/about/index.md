## About
I grew up in the Los Angeles area and love my family dearly. I stayed in LA County to complete my bachelor's in Physics and minor in Geophysics and Planetary Physics  at UCLA. After, I moved to Santa Cruz to complete my master's and doctorate in Astronomy and Astrophysics. During this time I got over my fear of the water and learned how to swim, eventually gaining the courage of get out on the ocean on a surfboard. After my PhD, I spent a short time working at UC Irvine as a UC presidential postdoc. I enjoyed waiting out rush hour traffic by gaming at the UC Irvine e-sports arena.

As of Fall 2022, I'm experiencing the beauty of the desert in the state of Arizona. I am a 51 Pegasi b and Presidential Fellow at the University of Arizona. I love taking care of plants, working with students, and novelty.
